Todo Task Management Dashboard is a responsive, front-end web application designed to help users efficiently manage daily tasks and view key metrics. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it provides a clean and user-friendly admin interface inspired by modern UI/UX principles.
The dashboard includes a collapsible sidebar for navigation, real-time style interaction for user hover and focus, and a mobile-friendly navigation drawer. Key sections include dynamic cards displaying task-related statistics, a table of recent orders with status indicators, and a visual list of recent customers.
This project is ideal for learning or demonstrating concepts like:
Responsive layout design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
Sidebar and drawer implementation using JavaScript
Accessible navigation with keyboard support and ARIA roles
UI interactivity and styling effects without frameworks.

The inspiration for this project came from the need for a simple, intuitive task management tool that also demonstrates solid front-end design principles. Many modern dashboards are built with heavy frameworks; this project was designed to:
Showcase what can be achieved with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Provide a responsive and accessible UI usable across devices and assistive technologies
Serve as a foundation for developers learning layout systems like Flexbox and Grid 
Highlight best practices in navigation UX, such as collapsible sidebars and mobile-friendly drawers
Encourage modular front-end design that can be easily extended into a full-stack app

This project lays the foundation for a scalable task management system. Potential future enhancements include:

🔐 User Authentication with OAuth (Google/GitHub) and JWT sessions

📝 CRUD Functionality for tasks using a backend (Node.js/Express, Firebase, or Supabase)

🌐 Database Integration to persist user tasks, customer data, and activity logs

📅 Calendar View for task scheduling and deadlines

🧠 Smart Filters & Search to quickly find tasks by status, assignee, or keyword

🔔 Real-Time Notifications using WebSockets (Socket.IO)

📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline access

📊 Analytics Dashboard with charts for productivity metrics

🧪 Unit & E2E Testing using Jest and Cypress
